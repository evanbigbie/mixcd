## Potential Future Employers:

I started using GitHub for version control in January of 2020, and came to understand the purpose and usefulness of a README even more recently than that. I have posted copies of this note for projects created during or before May of 2020 as a placeholder. All future projects will include a proper README. Thank you for your understanding as I continue learning and improving my knowledge of best practices.
