NOTES:

Not including playerpage.dart or playerpage_controller.dart until I know how player works


If I want to add packages other than authentication and firestore i should rewatch firebase config 4 flutter setup -- FlutterFire Docs and paste into pubspec.yaml

Video:
HomePage to BookPage

Me:
CDPage to SongPage


class Book --> CD:

imageURL
title --> name
author
pubyear --> nothing
sharedWith
review --> notes
createdBy
lastUpdatedAt
sharedWith

class Book --> Song

documentId
title --> name
No author
No pubyear
No imageUrl
No review
No createdBy
No lastUpdatedAt
No sharedWith for now

PICK BACK UP - - 43. from Save Button to Add Button

Watch BookPage 1,2,3... if something doesn't work with the SongPage

Email list stuff is in Boopage video 3

* May need to come back to myfirebase.dart to separate the songs into different collections ? Right now just have SONGSCOLLECTION

maybe can have a field in the song entries in database that specifies which CD it is linked to and what the track number is?

Need to come back and do 'access control' adding security rules to FireBase

Only MyFirebase_controller left (???)

------------------------------

1. How do I play the songs?

2. How do I make the songs display on the cdpage?

3. Change the look of the sharedpage


Add 'service' to database / user

SONGPAGE: Add functionality where songs are assigned to CDs and don't 
have to enter manually
