# Mix CD (2019)

A music app designed to simulate the nostalgic experience of creating mix CDs that can be shared with friends. Recipients may specify which streaming services they use so that shared mixes may be played by anyone who has access to \*any* streaming service (given track availability.) Only services which continue playing when phone is locked are available (no YouTube, etc.), the idea being that the mixes are listenable in a car while driving or on headphones with a locked phone in a pocket, as a tape or CD would be.

*Note: This was an academic project that I started during my junior year of undergrad. It is incomplete at this time.
